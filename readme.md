# Translate Quest

### Learning Objectives

- Apply OOP in PHP

### ðŸŒ± Must-haves

- Step 2: On submit, the answer gets validated, and the user get a success / fail message
  The final result should be deploy to a a live url of some kind

### ðŸŒ¼ Nice to have (doable)

- Retain the user score when he or she plays again with another word
- Allow a user to click a reset button and start over completely

### ðŸŒ³ Nice to have (hard)

- Have a phase before the quiz starts where you ask the nickname from the user
- Scoring will now be split in right and wrong answers
- Once the number of 10 right or wrong answers is reached, show an ending screen with the scoring
